Repository for "Blocked training facilitates learning of multiple schemas" (preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/9bptj/):

If you would like to generate the figures in the paper, please run the colab here https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/generate_paper_figures.ipynb. Note that we are working on adding the code for generating figures 2 and 5 to this notebook.

If you would like to run the model simulations with the parameter settings and configurations of simulations 1 to 3 and the simulation
3 variant (here referred to as simulation 4) in the paper, run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/running_4simulations_with_model.ipynb

If you would like to perform new data analyses on the human data, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/humanData_analysis_sandbox.ipynb

If you would like to run model simulations with your own custom parameter settings and see the results of those changes, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/new_simulation_sandbox.ipynb
