Repository for "Blocked training facilitates learning of multiple schemas" (preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/9bptj/):

If you would like to generate the figures in the paper, please run the colab here https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/generate_paper_figures.ipynb.

If you would like to run the model simulations with the parameter settings and configurations of simulations 1 to 3, the simulation
3 variant (here referred to as simulation 4), the individual differences in stickiness model (here referred to as simulation 5), the individual differences in sparsity model (here referred to as simulation 6), and the Bayesian optimal predictive distribution variant of simulation 3 (here referred to as simulation 7), then run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/running_4simulations_with_model.ipynb

If you would like to perform new data analyses on the human data, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/humanData_analysis_sandbox.ipynb

If you would like to run model simulations with your own custom parameter settings and see the results of those changes, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/new_simulation_sandbox.ipynb
