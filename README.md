Repository for "Blocked training facilitates learning of multiple schemas" (preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/9bptj/):

If you would like to generate the figures in the paper, please run the colab here https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/generate_paper_figures.ipynb.

Run the colab here, https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/running_7simulations_with_model.ipynb, for model simulations with the same parameter settings and configurations for:
 - simulations 1 to 3
 - the supplementary simulation 3 variant with schema inference switched off after the first block for blocked and early conditions (here referred to as simulation 4)
 - the supplementary individual differences in stickiness model (here referred to as simulation 5)
 - the supplementary individual differences in sparsity model (here referred to as simulation 6)
 - the supplementary Bayesian optimal predictive distribution variant of simulation 3 (here referred to as simulation 7)

If you would like to perform new data analyses on the human data, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/csw_paper_final/blob/master/humanData_analysis_sandbox.ipynb

If you would like to run model simulations with your own custom parameter settings and see the results of those changes, please run the colab here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PrincetonCompMemLab/blocked_training_facilitates_learning/blob/master/new_simulation_sandbox.ipynb
